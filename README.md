- Select "Install Plugin from Disk"
- Select the IntelliJHeader.jar file
- That's it, you're done with installation

## How to use

Default keybinds are **F1** to generate a header and **ctrl + S** to update the header.
However these binds are already used by IntelliJ by default. 
You can either unset the **Help** and **Save All** keybinds or set other binds for **Generate Header** and **Update Header**
